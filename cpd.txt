CPD activity
Introduction to Web Development (Third Session)


What have I learnt?

Tools galore day! Learnt to install the various tools required for the course such as GitHub Desktop, VS Code and generally fille
up my Dev-Toolbox with resouces that will come in useful when learning to code. 

Luke gave us quite a lot to chew on and my task this week is to digest all that was learnt today and make sure I put it to good practice.

Learning has been quite quick and intense. I have enjoyed it so far but feel like I need a lot more practice for the concepts to embed.


How did I use this in practice?

I am looking to finding more projects to sharpen my skills.


What did I find hard?

Catching up as I had connection issues to start with which soon stabilised. Luke was very good in bringing anyone who was stuck back to speed with the rest of the cohort.
The concepts are understood during the lesson but then I seem to forget next lesson. I think they will only embed with more practice
