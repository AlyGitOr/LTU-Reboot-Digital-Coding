<h4>What have I learnt?</h4>

<p>Tools galore day! Learnt to install the various tools required for the course such as GitHub Desktop, VS Code and generally fille
  up my Dev-Toolbox with resouces that will come in useful when learning to code. </p>

Luke gave us quite a lot to chew on and my task this week is to digest all that was learnt today and make sure I put it to good practice.


<h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>




<h4>What did I find hard?</h4>

<p>Catching up as I had connection issues to start with which soon stabilised. Luke was very good in bringing anyone who was stuck back to speed with the rest of the cohort.</p>
