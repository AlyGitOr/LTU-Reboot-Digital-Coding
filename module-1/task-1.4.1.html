  CPD activity
Introduction to Web Development (Third Session)


What have I learnt?

Tools galore day! Learnt to install the various tools required for the course such as GitHub Desktop, VS Code and generally fille
up my Dev-Toolbox with resouces that will come in useful when learning to code. 

Luke gave us quite a lot to chew on and my task this week is to digest all that was learnt today and make sure I put it to good practice.


How did I use this in practice?




What did I find hard?

Catching up as I had connection issues to start with which soon stabilised. Luke was very good in bringing anyone who was stuck back to speed with the rest of the cohort.
